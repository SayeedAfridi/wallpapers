# Wallpapers

Most of the wallpapers so far are stolen from Luke Smith's wallpaper-repository, but have added some more, most of which i got from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a website dedicated to high resolution free use images.
Luke however, got a lot of his from [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).

## Ownership

Since Luke's main resource of images is /wg/, some of the images might be legitimately copyrighted. If you see an image that is yours and of limited use, feel free to tell me and I will remove it.
